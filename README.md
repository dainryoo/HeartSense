# HEART SENSE

By creating, visualizing, and encouraging reflection on circumscribed datasets, we strive to approach physiological data for its capacity to inspire an alternative epistemological and experimental engagement from either standard scientific visualization or the quantified self.

Ours is an object oriented feminist approach: "in light of a specific and particular materiality to hand, what if we see the world like this?"
